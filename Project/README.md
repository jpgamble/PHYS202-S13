In this directory I've saved all my work for 
each section (ruleset STCA, CA184, and ASEP) in individualized notebooks. 
 
To see my finalized data, data interpretation, and work click on 
the Notebook whose name is the Ruleset and that is followed by "-FinalProduct"
To see the work leading up to the end result click on the Notebook whose name 
is the desired ruleset and is followed by "-Work"
